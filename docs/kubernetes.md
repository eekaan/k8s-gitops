# The kubernetes/ tree

`kubernetes/` is everything Flux reconciles; CI publishes it as the cluster's artifact
(ADR 0003). `just kubernetes-check` builds it offline with kustomize and Flux, and fails, naming
the file, when a cluster directory, a `ks.yaml`, an application directory or a variable breaks
the rules below.

## Layout

- `clusters/<cluster>/`: the cluster's root Kustomization in `ks.yaml`; Flux's own two
  applications in `flux-system/flux-operator/` and `flux-system/flux-instance/` (see
  [Flux itself](#flux-itself)); a `kustomization.yaml` that lists the root's and those two
  `ks.yaml` files and nothing else; and the example key lists, which nothing lists.
- `apps/overlays/<cluster>/kustomization.yaml`: what the cluster runs.
- `apps/base/<namespace>/`: a namespace directory, with `namespace.yaml` and a
  `kustomization.yaml` that sets the namespace and includes `components/common`.
- `apps/base/<namespace>/<app>/`: an application, its Flux Kustomization in `ks.yaml` and its
  manifests in `app/`.
- `apps/base/flux-system/artifact-generator/`: publishes one artifact per application.
- `components/`: Kustomize components. `common` adds the `app-template-defaults` ConfigMap, which
  an app-template HelmRelease opts into through `valuesFrom`.

## Adding an application

Put the manifests in `apps/base/<namespace>/<app>/app/` with their own `kustomization.yaml`, and
this `ks.yaml` beside the directory:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: <app>
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  path: ./apps/base/<namespace>/<app>/app
  targetNamespace: <namespace>
  sourceRef:
    kind: ExternalArtifact
    name: <app>
```

- `<app>` is a DNS label (lowercase letters, digits and `-`) and unique across every namespace,
  enabled or not. `metadata.name` and `sourceRef.name` are `<app>`, `targetNamespace` is
  `<namespace>`, and `path` is the application's own `app/`.
- `dependsOn`, `wait`, `healthCheckExprs`, `components` and `postBuild.substitute` belong to the
  application. The fields the root sets do not; see below.
- A new namespace gets its directory: `namespace.yaml` with the Pod Security labels and the
  annotation `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/prune: disabled`, so removing it from the tree does not
  delete what runs in it.

Enable the application by listing its namespace directory, once, and its `ks.yaml` in
`apps/overlays/<cluster>/kustomization.yaml`. A disabled application stays in the list,
commented out with the reason:

```yaml
  # - ../../base/demo/hello/ks.yaml  # Disabled: <reason>
```

## What the root sets

The root Kustomization patches every child Kustomization with:

- `interval: 30m`, `retryInterval: 1m`, `timeout: 3m`, `prune: true`,
  `deletionPolicy: WaitForTermination` and SOPS `decryption`;
- `postBuild.substituteFrom` with the ConfigMap `cluster-config` and the Secret `cluster-secrets`;
- `patches` holding the defaults for every HelmRelease the child applies: install and upgrade
  remediation with three retries and rollback, CRDs created and replaced, Helm tests, drift
  detection and a history of three releases.

These overwrite the child's own values, and lists such as `patches` are replaced whole, so a
child that sets any of these fields without opting out fails the check.

## Labels

- `k8s-gitops/defaults: disabled` on a child Kustomization: none of the defaults apply, and the
  child sets `interval`, `prune` and anything else it needs itself. On a HelmRelease: that
  release gets none of the release defaults.
- `k8s-gitops/timeout: long` on a child Kustomization: a 10m timeout with every other default
  kept. It does nothing on a child that opted out.

## Every child Kustomization is in flux-system

`postBuild.substituteFrom` has no namespace field: Flux reads the ConfigMap and Secret from the
Kustomization's own namespace. `cluster-config` and `cluster-secrets` live in `flux-system`, so
every child Kustomization lives there too and sets `targetNamespace` for what it deploys.

## Variables

- `${VAR}` is replaced from `cluster-config` or `cluster-secrets`. Their values are never
  committed in plain text; their key names are, with placeholder values, in
  `clusters/<cluster>/cluster-config.example.yaml` and `cluster-secrets.example.yaml`. Add a key
  there when a manifest starts using it.
- `${VAR:=value}` gives a default.
- Values for one application go in its `postBuild.substitute`.
- `$${VAR}` reaches the application as `${VAR}`.
- Helm values are generated into a ConfigMap with the annotation
  `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/substitute: disabled`, which leaves any `${...}` in them alone;
  so does the annotation on any other object.

The check builds every application with Flux's strict substitution, using the placeholders, so a
variable that is none of the above fails it.

## Per-application artifacts

The ArtifactGenerator publishes each application's `app/` as an ExternalArtifact named after
the application, together with `components/`, at the same paths as in the tree, so a change
reconciles only the applications it touches (ADR 0004). Falling back to one shared source is a
`sourceRef` change in each `ks.yaml`, to `kind: OCIRepository` and `name: flux-system`.

## Resource definitions

Resource definitions that several applications use are applications of their own in
`apps/base/kube-system/`, so their version does not depend on whichever chart also bundles them:

- `prometheus-operator-crds`: every definition of the Prometheus Operator's `monitoring.coreos.com`
  group (ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, PrometheusRule and the rest), from the upstream
  `prometheus-operator-crds` chart, which ships them and nothing else.
- `gateway-api-crds`: the Gateway API's standard channel (`gateway.networking.k8s.io`). Its `app/`
  holds a `GitRepository` for the upstream repository at the release tag, checking out only
  `config/crd`, and an inner `Kustomization` that applies upstream's kustomization there, the one
  the release's `standard-install.yaml` is built from. Its patches leave out the release's
  `safe-upgrades` admission policy and binding, so it applies resource definitions only. Both
  objects live in `kube-system`, where the application's `targetNamespace` puts them; the inner
  `Kustomization` is not a child of the root, gets none of its defaults and substitutes nothing.

Both `ks.yaml` files set `wait`, so each is Ready only once its definitions are established. An
application that creates objects of these groups, or whose chart does, names the matching one in
`dependsOn` and turns off any copy of the same definitions its own chart would install. No
application does yet: no ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, dashboard or route is enabled anywhere.

Deleting a definition deletes every object of its kind, so neither application ever deletes one,
also not when it leaves the tree. Neither applies a definition itself. The monitoring chart's
values give each definition `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so Helm leaves them when Flux
uninstalls the release. The inner Gateway API `Kustomization` sets `prune: false` and
`deletionPolicy: Orphan`, so it leaves what it applied when it is deleted, and keeps a definition
a newer release drops. `tests/baseline.bats` renders the chart and builds the pinned Gateway API
source offline to check both, and that they yield definitions only.

## Flux itself

The Flux Operator and the `FluxInstance` it runs Flux from are the cluster directory's two
applications, `flux-system/flux-operator/` and `flux-system/flux-instance/`, the only ones outside
`apps/`. Each has the application shape: `ks.yaml`, and in `app/` an `OCIRepository` for the
chart, the `HelmRelease`, its `values.yaml` generated into a ConfigMap that substitution leaves
alone, and `kustomizeconfig.yaml`, which points the release at that ConfigMap's hashed name. The
application rules apply with two differences: `sourceRef` is `OCIRepository` `flux-system`, as the
artifact generator publishes only `apps/base`, and `path` is
`./clusters/<cluster>/flux-system/<app>/app`. No application in `apps/base` may take their names.

- **Charts**: the operator's own `flux-operator` and `flux-instance` charts from
  `oci://ghcr.io/controlplaneio-fluxcd/charts`, at one version that Renovate moves together. Each
  `OCIRepository` refuses a chart without the keyless cosign signature of the publisher's release
  workflow on a version tag.
- **Instance**: upstream Flux 2.x, with source-watcher beside the four default controllers for
  the per-application artifacts, and Flux's network policies on.
- **Flux versions**: the operator installs the newest Flux 2.x release in its manifests artifact,
  `oci://ghcr.io/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator-manifests`, which the instance pins to the
  operator chart's version. Flux therefore moves only when that tag moves, in the same Renovate
  pull request as the two charts, and a person merges it (ADR 0009); `tests/flux.bats` fails when
  the tag and the operator chart's version differ.
- **Sync**: the instance generates an `OCIRepository` and a `Kustomization`, both named
  `flux-system` after its namespace, that read `oci://ghcr.io/eekaan/k8s-gitops/manifests` at the
  tag `main` every minute and apply `./clusters/<cluster>`. Its patches make the source verify the
  artifact's keyless signature: issued by GitHub Actions to this repository's
  `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` on `refs/heads/main`. An artifact signed by a run on another
  branch or tag, or by another workflow, is refused (ADR 0003).

### One root

The instance's `flux-system` Kustomization applies the cluster directory: the root `cluster` from
`ks.yaml`, and `flux-operator` and `flux-instance`. The root applies `apps/overlays/<cluster>` and
gives its children the defaults above; it is the one root of the applications. `flux-system` sits
above it, and nothing in the tree defines a source or Kustomization of that name, so no two
objects apply the same thing. The instance patches `flux-system` with the same SOPS `decryption`
and `postBuild.substituteFrom` (`cluster-config`, `cluster-secrets`) that the root gives its
children, so the cluster directory's `ks.yaml` files are substituted like everything else;
`just kubernetes-check` builds each cluster directory as that Kustomization does, with strict
substitution. `flux-operator` and `flux-instance` are not children of the root and get none of
its defaults. They set the same `decryption` and `postBuild.substituteFrom` themselves, which the
check requires, so what they apply is decrypted and substituted like the root's children; and
they set their own interval, retry interval, timeout, `wait` and pruning. Their `HelmRelease`
objects likewise get none of the release defaults and set their own upgrade remediation: a failed
upgrade is retried three times, then rolled back. `flux-instance` waits for `flux-operator`, whose
chart defines the `FluxInstance` kind.

Both Kustomizations prune, but what manages Flux is kept from it. Their `HelmRelease` and chart
`OCIRepository` objects carry `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/prune: disabled`: garbage-collecting
the operator's release would uninstall the operator, and the instance's release would take the
`FluxInstance` with it, on which the operator deletes Flux's controllers. The instance chart also
gives the `FluxInstance` `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so even an uninstalled release leaves it
in place. The values ConfigMaps are still collected when a change of values replaces them.
Removing either Kustomization from the cluster directory's `kustomization.yaml` fails
`just kubernetes-check`, as the cluster directory must build exactly the root, `flux-operator` and
`flux-instance`.

### Controllers

The instance's patches give kustomize-controller `--sops-age-secret=sops-age`. The controller
reads the Secret `sops-age` from its own namespace, `flux-system`, and takes the age key from each
of its data keys whose name ends in `.agekey`, such as `age.agekey`. It decrypts with that key
every Kustomization that uses SOPS and names no Secret of its own in `decryption.secretRef`, which
in this tree is every one. Like `cluster-config` and `cluster-secrets`, the Secret exists before
Flux does and nothing in the tree creates it; until it exists, every Kustomization that decrypts
fails, the root and Flux's own included.

Flux 2.10 still gates `ExternalArtifact` sources, which source-watcher produces, behind a feature
gate on kustomize-controller and helm-controller. The operator turns the gate on by itself
whenever source-watcher is among the instance's components, so the instance does not patch it.

`tests/flux.bats` renders both charts with these values, pulling each chart once, and applies the
instance's patches to the pinned Flux manifests to check the sync source, its signature identity,
the components and the age-key flag.

## Applications installed before Flux

Flux cannot run before the cluster has a pod network, so the CNI, Cilium in
`apps/base/kube-system/cilium/`, is installed by a script first and adopted by Flux afterwards.
It is an application like any other, and the script reads it rather than a copy:

- `just cilium-install` runs `scripts/install-cilium` against the cluster the `KUBECONFIG`
  environment variable names. It takes the chart location and version from the application's
  `ocirepository.yaml`, the release name and namespace from its `helmrelease.yaml`, and gives
  `values.yaml` to helm as it is. It waits for the API server first and for every node to be
  Ready after, and leaves a release that already runs that chart version with those values alone.
- The HelmRelease sets `releaseName`, `targetNamespace` and `storageNamespace` to the release the
  script installs, so Flux upgrades that release instead of installing a second one.
- Substitution is disabled on the values ConfigMap, so the chart gets the same values on both
  paths, and a version change in `ocirepository.yaml` moves both.

`kube-system` exists before Flux does: its `namespace.yaml` only sets the namespace's labels, and
like every namespace it is never pruned.
